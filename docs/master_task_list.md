# Master Task List

Last updated: 2025-08-23

This document is the single source of truth for project tasks. Keep sections ordered by priority. Link issues/PRs where applicable.

Source docs for context:
- [docs/player_profile_development_plan.md](docs/player_profile_development_plan.md)
- [docs/player_profile_fresh_build_spec.md](docs/player_profile_fresh_build_spec.md)
- [docs/player_profile_style_guide.md](docs/player_profile_style_guide.md)
- [README.md](README.md)

Conventions:
- Backlog = not started. Add brief description and acceptance criteria link.
- In Progress = actively being worked. Include owner.
- Done = completed and verified.

## In Progress

- [-] Establish master task list and integrate with built-in task tracker

## Backlog

- [ ] Consolidate and import outstanding tasks from source docs listed above
- [ ] Scan codebase for TODO/FIXME and convert into backlog items
- [ ] Define acceptance criteria per feature/section and link to specs
- [ ] Set up CI: lint, type-check, and tests on pull requests
- [ ] Create .env.example and document required environment variables in README
- [ ] Add basic API route tests (media upload, twitter post, blog storage)
- [ ] Accessibility audit (WCAG AA) across public pages
- [ ] Performance pass (images, caching, bundle size) with measurable targets

## Done

  - API: GET/POST [src/app/api/photos/route.ts](src/app/api/photos/route.ts), PATCH/DELETE [src/app/api/photos/[id]/route.ts](src/app/api/photos/%5Bid%5D/route.ts)
  - Library: Types [src/lib/photos/types.ts](src/lib/photos/types.ts), JSON DB [src/lib/photos/db.ts](src/lib/photos/db.ts), FS helpers [src/lib/photos/fs.ts](src/lib/photos/fs.ts), Service [src/lib/photos/service.ts](src/lib/photos/service.ts), Dev guards [src/lib/auth/guards.ts](src/lib/auth/guards.ts)
  - UI: Dashboard page [src/app/dashboard/photos/page.tsx](src/app/dashboard/photos/page.tsx), Components [src/components/photos/Uploader.tsx](src/components/photos/Uploader.tsx), [src/components/photos/PhotoTile.tsx](src/components/photos/PhotoTile.tsx)
  - Acceptance verified:
